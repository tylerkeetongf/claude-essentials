## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need Claude Code installed. If you don't have it yet, head to [claude.com/product/claude-code](https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code).

### Setup

1. Add this marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/rileyhilliard/claude-essentials
```

2. Install the ce plugin:

```bash
/plugin install ce
```

That's it! You now have access to all commands, skills, and agents under the `ce` namespace.

### Verify Installation

Start Claude Code and try these:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Try a quick command
/ce:explain README.md

# Use a skill
ce:writing-tests

# Use a skill
ce:architecting-systems
```

---

## Bootstrapping Your Repository

The `/ce:init` command sets up your repository with Claude Code configuration that follows best practices. This is the recommended first step when starting work on any project.

### What It Does

**Fresh repositories** (no `.claude/` directory):

1. Detects your project stack (Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go, etc.)
2. Generates a complete `.claude/` configuration:

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md           # Project overview, architecture, quick commands
├── settings.json       # Permissions tailored to your stack
└── rules/
    ├── testing.md          # References ce:writing-tests
    ├── error-handling.md   # References ce:handling-errors
    ├── debugging.md        # References ce:systematic-debugging
    ├── verification.md     # References ce:verification-before-completion
    └── {stack}/            # Stack-specific rules (python/, frontend/, etc.)
```

**Existing configurations** (`.claude/` already exists):

1. Audits your current setup against best practices
2. Identifies missing skill references in rules
3. Suggests permission and rule improvements
4. Offers to apply fixes with your confirmation

### Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a new project
/ce:init

# Audit an existing configuration
/ce:init --audit

# Force regenerate (overwrites existing)
/ce:init --force
```

### Why This Matters

The generated configuration:

- **Progressive disclosure** - Rules stay concise (<100 lines), reference ce:* skills for depth, use `references/` subdirectories for domain-specific details
- **Rules reference ce:* skills** - Don't duplicate content, point to proven patterns
- **Permissions are stack-aware** - Python projects get `uv`, `pytest`; Node gets `npm`, `bun`, etc.
- **Safety defaults included** - Blocks `rm -rf`, force pushes, hard resets
- **Path-scoped rules** - Activate only when working in relevant files

**Progressive disclosure structure:**
```
rules/
├── testing.md              # ~50 lines, points to ce:writing-tests
└── api/
    ├── conventions.md      # ~100 lines, overview
    └── references/         # Loaded on-demand
        ├── errors.md       # Detailed error patterns
        └── pagination.md   # Pagination strategies
```

This keeps context small while maintaining depth. Claude loads reference files only when needed.

Based on [Claude platform best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices).

## Usage Examples

### Typical Workflows

**Bootstrap a new project:**

```bash
cd my-project
/ce:init
# Review the generated config, confirm, done
```

**Fix failing tests:**

```bash
/ce:test
# If complex, escalate:
ce:systematic-debugging
```

**Review before merge:**

```bash
/ce:review
git add .
/ce:commit
```

**Optimize performance:**

```bash
/ce:optimize src/components/DataTable.tsx
# For deep analysis:
ce:optimizing-performance
```

**Plan a feature:**

```bash
ce:architecting-systems I need to add real-time notifications. We have 10k concurrent users.
# Then create a plan:
ce:writing-plans
```

**Clean up legacy code:**

```bash
/ce:explain src/legacy/payment-processor.js
ce:refactoring-code
```

### Understanding the System

**Commands vs Skills vs Agents:**

- **Commands** (`/ce:test`, `/ce:review`) are quick keyboard shortcuts for routine tasks
- **Skills** (`ce:writing-tests`) are reusable workflows that guide specific development patterns
- **Agents** (`@ce:code-reviewer`) are expert personas for complex, multi-step work

Use commands for quick actions, skills for following proven patterns, and agents when you need specialized expertise.

## Customization

All components are just markdown files organized in directories. Want to customize? Edit them directly in `~/.claude/plugins/ce/`.

### Creating Your Own Command

Add a markdown file to `~/.claude/plugins/ce/commands/`:

```markdown
---
description: Your command description
argument-hint: "[optional-arg]"
allowed-tools: Bash, Read
---

Your command instructions here.
```

This will be accessible as `/ce:your-command`.

### Creating Your Own Skill

Add a directory with SKILL.md to `~/.claude/plugins/ce/skills/`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill Instructions

Your skill workflow here.
```

This will be accessible as `ce:my-skill`.

### Creating Your Own Agent

Add a markdown file to `~/.claude/plugins/ce/agents/`:

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Expert at specific domain
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash
color: blue
---

Your agent personality and workflow here.
```

This will be accessible as `@ce:my-agent`.

## Project Structure

└── plugins/
    └── ce/
        ├── .claude-plugin/
        │   └── plugin.json       # Plugin metadata
        ├── commands/             # 14 commands (/ce:test, /ce:plan, /ce:init, etc.)
        ├── skills/               # 20 skills (ce:writing-tests, etc.)
        ├── agents/               # 4 agents (@ce:code-reviewer, @ce:haiku, etc.)
        └── hooks/                # Session automation
```

## Tips

**Commands accept arguments:** Most commands work with optional parameters.

```bash
/ce:test pytest tests/unit
/ce:explain AuthController
/ce:optimize src/components/
```

**Skills are for learning:** Invoke a skill to understand a pattern, then apply it.

```bash
ce:writing-tests
# Follow the guidance to write tests
```

**Agents need context:** Give agents rich context for better results.

```bash
# Vague
ce:architecting-systems help with authentication

# Better
ce:architecting-systems We need OAuth2 + JWT authentication for a React SPA with Node backend. 50k users.
```

**Run tests first:** Use `/ce:test` before committing to catch issues early.
