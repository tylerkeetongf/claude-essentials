# Condition-Based Waiting

**Use with:** `writing-tests` skill for overall test writing guidance. This skill focuses specifically on eliminating timing-based flakiness.

## Overview

Flaky tests often guess at timing with arbitrary delays. This creates race conditions where tests pass on fast machines but fail under load or in CI.

**Core principle:** Wait for the actual condition you care about, not a guess about how long it takes.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Test uses setTimeout/sleep?" [shape=diamond];
    "Testing timing behavior?" [shape=diamond];
    "Document WHY timeout needed" [shape=box];
    "Use condition-based waiting" [shape=box];

    "Test uses setTimeout/sleep?" -> "Testing timing behavior?" [label="yes"];
    "Testing timing behavior?" -> "Document WHY timeout needed" [label="yes"];
    "Testing timing behavior?" -> "Use condition-based waiting" [label="no"];
}
```

**Use when:**

- Tests have arbitrary delays (`setTimeout`, `sleep`, `time.sleep()`)
- Tests are flaky (pass sometimes, fail under load)
- Tests timeout when run in parallel
- Waiting for async operations to complete

**Don't use when:**

- Testing actual timing behavior (debounce, throttle intervals)
- Always document WHY if using arbitrary timeout

## Core Pattern

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE: Guessing at timing
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 50));
const result = getResult();
expect(result).toBeDefined();

// ✅ AFTER: Waiting for condition
await waitFor(() => getResult() !== undefined);
const result = getResult();
expect(result).toBeDefined();
```

## Implementation

**Note:** Use your test framework's built-in `waitFor` if available (e.g., React Testing Library, Playwright). The implementation below is for custom scenarios.

```typescript
async function waitFor<T>(
  condition: () => T | undefined | null | false,
  description: string,
  timeoutMs = 5000
): Promise<T> {
  const startTime = Date.now();

  while (true) {
    const result = condition();
    if (result) return result;

    if (Date.now() - startTime > timeoutMs) {
      throw new Error(
        `Timeout waiting for ${description} after ${timeoutMs}ms`
      );
    }

    // setTimeout OK here: used for polling mechanism, not test delay
    await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 10));
  }
}
```

**Common use cases:**

- `waitFor(() => events.find(e => e.type === 'DONE'), 'done event')`
- `waitFor(() => machine.state === 'ready', 'ready state')`
- `waitFor(() => items.length >= 5, '5+ items')`
- `waitFor(() => obj.ready && obj.value > 10, 'complex condition')`

See @example.ts for complete implementation with domain-specific helpers.

## Common Mistakes

**❌ Polling too fast:** `setTimeout(check, 1)` - wastes CPU
**✅ Fix:** Poll every 50ms

**❌ No timeout:** Loop forever if condition never met
**✅ Fix:** Always include timeout with clear error

**❌ Stale data:** Cache state before loop
**✅ Fix:** Call getter inside loop for fresh data

## When Arbitrary Timeout IS Correct

```typescript
// Tool ticks every 100ms - need 2 ticks to verify partial output
await waitForEvent(manager, "TOOL_STARTED"); // First: wait for condition
await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 200)); // Then: wait for timed behavior
// 200ms = 2 ticks at 100ms intervals - documented and justified
```

**Requirements:**

1. First wait for triggering condition
2. Based on known timing (not guessing)
3. Comment explaining WHY
