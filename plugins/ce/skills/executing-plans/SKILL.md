# Executing Plans

Load plan, analyze dependencies, execute in parallel waves, verify at completion.

**Core principle:** Autonomous execution. Run to completion, only stop for true blockers.

## Plan Loading

Identify and parse the plan:

**Single-file plans** (explicit path):

- User provides path like `./plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature.md`
- Parse `### Task N:` sections
- Extract `**Files:**` blocks for dependency analysis
- Extract `Run:` commands for verification

**Multi-file plans** (folder structure):

- User provides folder path like `./plans/YYYY-MM-DD-feature/`
- Start with `README.md` - this is the master tracking document
- Parse the phase table in Section 4 to identify phase files and their status
- Load each phase file (`phase-N-*.md`) for task details
- Execute phases in order based on prerequisites

**Native plan-mode** (current session):

- Plan is already in the conversation context from plan mode
- No need to search `~/.claude/plans/` - that would risk loading stale plans from other sessions
- Parse the plan content directly from context
- Parse numbered lists, checklists, or markdown sections as tasks
- Infer file targets from task descriptions

Create TodoWrite with all parsed tasks before execution.

## Dependency Analysis

Analyze file overlap to group tasks into execution waves.

**Tasks are independent (same wave) when:**

- No overlapping file paths (create/modify/test)
- Different subsystems (different top-level directories)
- No explicit ordering in plan

**Tasks depend on each other (sequential waves) when:**

- Task A modifies a file Task B creates
- Task A imports from Task B's output
- Task A tests functionality Task B implements
- Plan explicitly states ordering

**Example wave computation:**

```
Task 1: Create src/utils/formatter.ts
Task 2: Create src/utils/validator.ts
Task 3: Modify src/api/handler.ts (imports formatter, validator)
Task 4: Create tests/api/handler.test.ts

Wave 1: [Task 1, Task 2]  <- parallel, no overlap
Wave 2: [Task 3]          <- depends on wave 1
Wave 3: [Task 4]          <- depends on wave 2
```

If dependency analysis is unclear, ask before proceeding.

## Wave Execution

For each wave, dispatch all tasks in parallel using multiple Task tool calls in a single message:

```
# Wave 1 - dispatch simultaneously
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task 1: Create formatter utility"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task 1 from [plan-file].

    Read the task details. Your job:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests if task includes them
    3. Run verification commands from the plan
    4. Commit your work with descriptive message

    Scope: src/utils/formatter.ts only
    Constraints: Do NOT modify files outside your scope

    Report back:
    - What you implemented
    - Files changed
    - Verification output
    - Any issues encountered

Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task 2: Create validator utility"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task 2 from [plan-file].
    [same structure, different scope]
```

Wait for all parallel tasks to complete. Mark completed in TodoWrite. Proceed to next wave.

## Multi-File Plan Execution

For plans split across multiple files, execute at the phase level with progress tracking.

**Execution flow:**

1. Read `README.md` to understand overall structure and current progress
2. Load context from Section 3 (Context Loading)
3. Check phase table for first incomplete phase
4. Load that phase file and execute its tasks using wave-based execution
5. Update README.md phase status when complete
6. Repeat until all phases complete

**Phase status tracking:**

After completing each phase, update the README.md phase table:

```markdown
| Phase | Document                                           | Status      | Description               |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 1     | [phase-1-foundation.md](./phase-1-foundation.md)   | COMPLETED   | Core infrastructure setup |
| 2     | [phase-2-features.md](./phase-2-features.md)       | IN_PROGRESS | Feature implementation    |
| 3     | [phase-3-integration.md](./phase-3-integration.md) | NOT_STARTED | Integration and polish    |
```

Also update the phase file's own status header:

```markdown
> **Status:** COMPLETED
```

**Resuming interrupted multi-file plans:**

When resuming execution of a multi-file plan:

1. Read README.md phase table to find current state
2. Find first phase with status `IN_PROGRESS` or `NOT_STARTED`
3. If a phase is `IN_PROGRESS`, read its task checkboxes to find incomplete tasks
4. Resume from the first incomplete task

**Phase-level parallelization:**

Phases typically execute sequentially (Phase 2 depends on Phase 1). However, if the README.md explicitly marks phases as independent:

```markdown
## 5. Execution Order

Phases 2 and 3 can run in parallel after Phase 1 completes.
```

Then dispatch those phases as parallel subagents:

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Execute Phase 2: Features"
  prompt: |
    Execute all tasks in ./plans/2024-01-15-feature/phase-2-features.md
    [standard execution instructions]

Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Execute Phase 3: Integration"
  prompt: |
    Execute all tasks in ./plans/2024-01-15-feature/phase-3-integration.md
    [standard execution instructions]
```

**Subagent prompt requirements:**

- Specific scope (which files)
- Clear constraints (stay in scope)
- Expected report format
- Plan file reference for context

### Common Mistakes

**Too broad:** "Fix all the tests" - agent gets lost trying to tackle everything at once.
Better: "Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts" - focused scope the agent can actually handle.

**No context:** "Fix the race condition" - agent doesn't know where to look.
Better: Paste the error messages and test names so the agent has something concrete to work with.

**No constraints:** Agent might refactor your entire codebase when you just wanted a small fix.
Better: "Do NOT change production code" or "Fix tests only" - explicit boundaries.

**Vague output:** "Fix it" - you have no idea what actually changed.
Better: "Return summary of root cause and changes" - structured report you can verify.

### When NOT to Parallelize

Not every multi-task situation benefits from parallel agents:

- **Related failures:** If fixing one problem might fix others, investigate together first
- **Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet - need to understand the system
- **Shared state:** Agents would interfere (editing same files, using same resources)
- **Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing the entire system, not isolated pieces

### Agent Selection

Choose the right agent type based on task complexity:

**Use `ce:haiku` (Haiku) when:**

- Task is purely mechanical with no judgment needed
- Instructions are complete and unambiguous
- Single file scope with clear inputs/outputs
- Examples: creating boilerplate from a template, running predefined commands, simple additions with exact specs provided

**Use `general-purpose` when:**

- Task requires investigation or exploration
- Implementation approach isn't fully specified
- Task might encounter unexpected issues needing judgment
- Multiple files with potential interdependencies
- Examples: implementing features, fixing bugs, tasks requiring test verification

```
# Mixed agent example
Task tool (ce:haiku):
  description: "Create config file"
  prompt: |
    Create src/config/defaults.ts with this exact content:
    export const DEFAULTS = { timeout: 5000, retries: 3 };

Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement retry logic"
  prompt: |
    Implement retry logic in src/api/client.ts using the config.
    Handle edge cases appropriately.
    Write tests for retry behavior.
```

The heuristic: if the task needs thinking, use general-purpose. If it's copy-paste with a destination, use ce:haiku.

## Auto-Recovery

When a subagent reports failure, classify and respond:

**Recoverable errors** - dispatch fix subagent:

- Test failures
- Type errors
- Lint issues
- Build errors with clear cause

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Fix Task N errors"
  prompt: |
    Task N from [plan-file] failed with:

    [error output]

    Files involved: [list]

    Fix the errors and verify the fix works.
    Commit when resolved.

    Report: What caused it, what you fixed, verification result
```

**True blockers** - stop and ask:

- Missing dependencies that can't be inferred
- Ambiguous instructions
- Security concerns (secrets, unsafe operations)
- Circular dependencies
- Same error failing 2+ times after fix attempts

When stopped, report what was completed and ask for guidance.

## Final Verification

After all waves complete (or all phases for multi-file plans):

1. **Run full test suite** (not just individual task tests)
2. **Run build/compile** to verify everything integrates
3. **Run linter** to catch remaining issues

4. **Dispatch code-reviewer for comprehensive review:**

```
Task tool (ce:code-reviewer):
  description: "Review complete implementation"
  prompt: |
    Review the entire implementation from [plan-file or plan-folder/README.md].

    Compare current state against main branch (or pre-plan state).

    Assess:
    - All plan requirements met (check success criteria in spec)
    - Architecture alignment
    - Cross-cutting concerns (error handling, logging, security)
    - Test coverage adequate
    - Merge readiness

    Provide: Summary, any critical issues, recommendations. Only highlight issues, do not output complements. We only care about what needs to be fixed/refactored.
```

Fix all issues that are identified

5. **Update plan status:**

   - Single-file: Update `> **Status:** COMPLETED` header
   - Multi-file: Update README.md header status AND mark all phase statuses as `COMPLETED`

6. **Archive completed plan:**
   Move the plan from `plans/` to a sibling `done/` folder to keep the plans directory clean:

   ```bash
   # Create done folder if it doesn't exist (sibling to plans/)
   mkdir -p <parent-of-plans>/done

   # Move the completed plan
   # Single-file: plans/2024-01-15-feature.md → done/2024-01-15-feature.md
   # Multi-file:  plans/2024-01-15-feature/  → done/2024-01-15-feature/
   mv <plan-path> <parent-of-plans>/done/
   ```

7. **Present summary and options:**
   - Implementation complete: [summary]
   - Tests: [pass/fail count]
   - Review findings: [summary]
   - Options: Create PR / Commit to branch / Address findings first

## When to Stop

**Stop and ask for:**

- Ambiguous plan instructions that can't be inferred
- Security concerns (secrets in code, unsafe operations)
- Circular dependencies that can't be resolved
- Repeated auto-recovery failures (same error 2+ times)
- Missing critical information (no test command, no build command)

**Do NOT stop for:**

- Fixable test failures (auto-recover)
- Type errors (auto-recover)
- Style/lint issues (auto-recover)
- Minor review suggestions (note and continue)
- Warnings that don't block execution
