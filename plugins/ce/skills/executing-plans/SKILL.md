# Executing Plans

Execute plans by dispatching one agent per task. A task is a complete unit of work - all its steps are handled by a single agent.

## Core Rules

1. **One task = one agent** - Never split a task across multiple agents
2. **Parallelize tasks** - Independent tasks (different subsystems) can run in parallel
3. **Never parallelize steps** - Steps within a task are sequential, same agent

## Execution Flow

1. Load the plan file
2. Create TodoWrite with all tasks
3. Dispatch agents for independent tasks in parallel
4. **Update plan file** - Mark task checkboxes complete, update status to IN_PROGRESS
5. Wait for completion, then dispatch dependent tasks
6. Run final verification (tests, build, lint)
7. Dispatch `ce:code-reviewer` for review
8. **Update plan status** to COMPLETED when done

## Task Dispatch

```
# Independent tasks - dispatch in parallel
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Task 1: Add auth module"
  prompt: |
    Execute Task 1 from [plan-file].
    Complete ALL steps in this task.
    Verify and commit when done.
    Report: files changed, test results

Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Task 2: Add billing module"
  prompt: |
    Execute Task 2 from [plan-file].
    Complete ALL steps in this task.
    Verify and commit when done.
    Report: files changed, test results
```

## When to Parallelize

**Parallel:** Tasks touch different subsystems with no file overlap

```
Task 1: src/auth/*      ─┬─ parallel
Task 2: src/billing/*   ─┘
```

**Sequential:** Tasks have dependencies or shared files

```
Task 1: Create types    → Task 2: Use types (depends on 1)
```

**Combine:** Multiple small changes in same area should be one task in one agent, not parallel tasks

## Agent Selection

- **general-purpose**: Default for most tasks
- **ce:haiku**: Only for purely mechanical tasks (copy file, add single export, log parse, etc)

## Progress Tracking

Update the plan file as you execute:

1. Set plan status to `IN_PROGRESS` when starting
2. Check off `[x]` each step as agents complete them
3. After each task completes, verify its checkbox steps are marked done
4. Set plan status to `COMPLETED` when all tasks pass verification

This keeps the plan file as the source of truth for progress.

## Auto-Recovery

If a task fails:

1. Dispatch a fix agent with the error output
2. If same error twice, stop and ask user

## Final Verification

After all tasks:

1. Run full test suite and linters
2. Run build
3. Dispatch `ce:code-reviewer` agent to review changes
4. Plan and fix issues found
5. Mark plan COMPLETED
