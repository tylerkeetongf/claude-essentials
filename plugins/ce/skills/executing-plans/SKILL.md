# Executing Plans

Load plan, analyze dependencies, execute in parallel waves, verify at completion.

**Core principle:** Autonomous execution. Run to completion, only stop for true blockers.

## Plan Loading

Identify and parse the plan:

**Custom plan files** (explicit path):
- User provides path like `./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-PLAN.md`
- Parse `### Task N:` sections
- Extract `**Files:**` blocks for dependency analysis
- Extract `Run:` commands for verification

**Native plan-mode** (current session):
- Plan is already in the conversation context from plan mode
- No need to search `~/.claude/plans/` - that would risk loading stale plans from other sessions
- Parse the plan content directly from context
- Parse numbered lists, checklists, or markdown sections as tasks
- Infer file targets from task descriptions

Create TodoWrite with all parsed tasks before execution.

## Dependency Analysis

Analyze file overlap to group tasks into execution waves.

**Tasks are independent (same wave) when:**
- No overlapping file paths (create/modify/test)
- Different subsystems (different top-level directories)
- No explicit ordering in plan

**Tasks depend on each other (sequential waves) when:**
- Task A modifies a file Task B creates
- Task A imports from Task B's output
- Task A tests functionality Task B implements
- Plan explicitly states ordering

**Example wave computation:**
```
Task 1: Create src/utils/formatter.ts
Task 2: Create src/utils/validator.ts
Task 3: Modify src/api/handler.ts (imports formatter, validator)
Task 4: Create tests/api/handler.test.ts

Wave 1: [Task 1, Task 2]  <- parallel, no overlap
Wave 2: [Task 3]          <- depends on wave 1
Wave 3: [Task 4]          <- depends on wave 2
```

If dependency analysis is unclear, ask before proceeding.

## Wave Execution

For each wave, dispatch all tasks in parallel using multiple Task tool calls in a single message:

```
# Wave 1 - dispatch simultaneously
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task 1: Create formatter utility"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task 1 from [plan-file].

    Read the task details. Your job:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests if task includes them
    3. Run verification commands from the plan
    4. Commit your work with descriptive message

    Scope: src/utils/formatter.ts only
    Constraints: Do NOT modify files outside your scope

    Report back:
    - What you implemented
    - Files changed
    - Verification output
    - Any issues encountered

Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task 2: Create validator utility"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task 2 from [plan-file].
    [same structure, different scope]
```

Wait for all parallel tasks to complete. Mark completed in TodoWrite. Proceed to next wave.

**Subagent prompt requirements:**
- Specific scope (which files)
- Clear constraints (stay in scope)
- Expected report format
- Plan file reference for context

## Auto-Recovery

When a subagent reports failure, classify and respond:

**Recoverable errors** - dispatch fix subagent:
- Test failures
- Type errors
- Lint issues
- Build errors with clear cause

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Fix Task N errors"
  prompt: |
    Task N from [plan-file] failed with:

    [error output]

    Files involved: [list]

    Fix the errors and verify the fix works.
    Commit when resolved.

    Report: What caused it, what you fixed, verification result
```

**True blockers** - stop and ask:
- Missing dependencies that can't be inferred
- Ambiguous instructions
- Security concerns (secrets, unsafe operations)
- Circular dependencies
- Same error failing 2+ times after fix attempts

When stopped, report what was completed and ask for guidance.

## Final Verification

After all waves complete:

1. **Run full test suite** (not just individual task tests)
2. **Run build/compile** to verify everything integrates
3. **Run linter** to catch remaining issues

4. **Dispatch code-reviewer for comprehensive review:**
```
Task tool (ce:code-reviewer):
  description: "Review complete implementation"
  prompt: |
    Review the entire implementation from [plan-file].

    Compare current state against main branch (or pre-plan state).

    Assess:
    - All plan requirements met
    - Architecture alignment
    - Cross-cutting concerns (error handling, logging, security)
    - Test coverage adequate
    - Merge readiness

    Provide: Summary, any critical issues, recommendations
```

5. **Present summary and options:**
   - Implementation complete: [summary]
   - Tests: [pass/fail count]
   - Review findings: [summary]
   - Options: Create PR / Commit to branch / Address findings first

## When to Stop

**Stop and ask for:**
- Ambiguous plan instructions that can't be inferred
- Security concerns (secrets in code, unsafe operations)
- Circular dependencies that can't be resolved
- Repeated auto-recovery failures (same error 2+ times)
- Missing critical information (no test command, no build command)

**Do NOT stop for:**
- Fixable test failures (auto-recover)
- Type errors (auto-recover)
- Style/lint issues (auto-recover)
- Minor review suggestions (note and continue)
- Warnings that don't block execution

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Parallelization | Independent tasks in same wave |
| Review timing | Single final review at completion |
| Human checkpoints | None until final verification |
| Plan formats | Custom PLAN.md files or current session plan-mode |
| Error handling | Auto-recover, stop only for blockers |

## Integration

**Required:** `writing-plans` creates plans this skill executes

**Complementary:**
- `writing-tests` for TDD during task execution
- `verification-before-completion` for final verification patterns
- `dispatching-parallel-agents` for parallel dispatch patterns
