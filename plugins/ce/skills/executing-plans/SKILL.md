# Executing Plans

**You are an orchestrator.** Spawn and coordinate sub-agents to do the actual implementation. Group related tasks by subsystem (e.g., one agent for API routes, another for tests) rather than spawning per-task. Each agent re-investigates the codebase, so fewer agents with broader scope = faster execution.

## 1. Setup

**Create a branch** for the work unless trivial. Consider git worktrees for isolated environments.

**Clarify ambiguity upfront:** If the plan has unclear requirements or meaningful tradeoffs, use `AskUserQuestion` before starting. Present options with descriptions explaining the tradeoffs. Use `multiSelect: true` for independent features that can be combined; use single-select for mutually exclusive choices. Don't guess when the user can clarify in 10 seconds.

**Track progress with tasks:** Use `TaskCreate` to create tasks for each major work item from the plan. Update status with `TaskUpdate` as work progresses (`in_progress` when starting, `completed` when done). This makes execution visible to the user and persists across context compactions.

## 2. Group Tasks by Subsystem

Group related tasks to share agent context. One agent per subsystem, groups run in parallel.

**Why grouping matters:**
```
Without: Task 1 (auth/login) → Agent 1 [explores auth/]
         Task 2 (auth/logout) → Agent 2 [explores auth/ again]

With:    Tasks 1-2 (auth/*) → Agent 1 [explores once, executes both]
```

| Signal | Group together |
|--------|----------------|
| Same directory prefix | `src/auth/*` tasks |
| Same domain/feature | Auth tasks, billing tasks |
| Plan sections | Tasks under same `##` heading |

**Limits:** 3-4 tasks max per group. Split if larger.

**Parallel:** Groups touch different subsystems
```
Group A: src/auth/*    ─┬─ parallel
Group B: src/billing/* ─┘
```

**Sequential:** Groups have dependencies
```
Group A: Create shared types → Group B: Use those types
```

## 3. Execute

Dispatch sub-agents to complete task groups. Monitor progress and handle issues.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Auth tasks: login, logout"
  prompt: |
    Execute these tasks from [plan-file] IN ORDER:
    - Task 1: Add login endpoint
    - Task 2: Add logout endpoint

    Use skills: <relevant skills>
    Commit after each task. Report: files changed, test results
```

**Architectural fit:** Changes should integrate cleanly with existing patterns. If a change feels like it's fighting the architecture, that's a signal to refactor first rather than bolt something on. Don't reinvent wheels when battle-tested libraries exist, but don't reach for a dependency for trivial things either (no lodash just for `_.map`). The goal is zero tech debt, not "ship now, fix later."

**Auto-recovery:**
1. Agent attempts to fix failures (has context)
2. If can't fix, report failure with error output
3. Dispatch fix agent with context
4. Same error twice → stop and ask user

## 4. Verify

All four checks must pass before marking complete:

1. **Code review:** Use `ce:code-reviewer` to review all changes. Fix issues before proceeding. Poor DX/UX is a bug, treat it the same as a runtime error.

2. **Automated tests:** Run the full test suite. All tests must pass.

3. **Manual verification:** Automated tests aren't sufficient. Actually exercise the changes:
   - **API changes:** Curl endpoints with realistic payloads
   - **External integrations:** Test against real services to catch rate limiting, format drift, bot detection
   - **CLI changes:** Run actual commands, verify output
   - **Parser changes:** Feed real data, not just fixtures

4. **DX quality:** During manual testing, watch for friction:
   - Confusing error messages
   - Noisy output (telemetry spam, verbose logging)
   - Inconsistent behavior across similar endpoints
   - Rough edges that technically work but feel bad

   Fix DX issues inline or document for follow-up. Don't ship friction.

## 5. Commit

After verification passes, commit only the changes related to this plan:

1. Run `git status` to see all changes
2. **Stage files by name, not with `git add -A` or `git add .`** - only stage files you modified as part of this plan
3. **Leave unrelated changes alone** - if there are pre-existing staged or unstaged changes that aren't part of this work, don't touch them
4. Write a commit message that summarizes what was implemented, referencing the plan

## 6. Cleanup

After committing:
- Merge branch to main (if using branches)
- Remove worktree (if using worktrees)
- Mark plan file as COMPLETED
- Move to `./plans/done/` if applicable
