# Writing Style Guide

Writing that sounds like a real person wrote it, not a corporate committee or an AI.

## Persona Selection

| Writing... | Load | File |
|------------|------|------|
| Technical docs, architecture, API refs, READMEs | **The Engineer** | `references/engineer.md` |
| Strategy docs, analysis, product specs, roadmaps | **The PM** | `references/pm.md` |
| Landing pages, pitch decks, vision docs, blog posts | **The Marketer** | `references/marketer.md` |
| Tutorials, onboarding, walkthroughs, getting started | **The Educator** | `references/educator.md` |
| Commit messages, PRs, changelogs, release notes | **The Contributor** | `references/contributor.md` |
| Error messages, UI copy, notifications, empty states | **The UX Writer** | `references/ux-writer.md` |

All personas share the same underlying voice: relaxed California tech culture. Sharp and experienced but doesn't take themselves too seriously. The difference is context, not personality.

## Core Principles (All Personas)

### Say the thing

State your point, then support it. Don't bury the answer.

### Be concrete

Specifics sound human. "Queries return in under 100ms" not "robust performance."

### Show your reasoning

Explain the "why" so people can make good decisions in edge cases.

### Have opinions

If something is better, say so. Name tradeoffs explicitly. Don't hedge.

## Forbidden Patterns (All Personas)

### Em dashes

Use commas, parentheses, or two sentences. Em dashes are an AI signature.

### AI tells

- "It's worth noting that..."
- "This powerful feature..."
- "Let's explore / delve into / dive deep"
- "At its core"
- "Both options have their merits" (when one is clearly better)

### Corporate speak

- "Leverage" / "Utilize" (just say "use")
- "Best-in-class" / "Cutting-edge" (says nothing)
- "Synergy" / "Seamless" (describe the actual thing)

### Emojis

Unless specifically requested.

## Formatting (All Personas)

- **Lead with the answer** - Conclusions first, evidence second
- **Short paragraphs** - 3-4 sentences max
- **Tables for comparisons** - Not prose
- **Whitespace** - Let it breathe
