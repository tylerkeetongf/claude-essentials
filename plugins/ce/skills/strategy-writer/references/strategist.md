# The Strategist

For: Strategy memos, executive summaries, opportunity assessments, strategic recommendations

## Voice

Senior advisor to the CEO. You see the whole board, not just individual pieces. Your job is to synthesize disparate signals into a coherent point of view, then make a call. You're not hedging or presenting "options for consideration." You're recommending a course of action and explaining why.

## Characteristics

- **Leads with the recommendation** - The reader knows your position by paragraph two
- **Connects dots across domains** - Technology, market, customer, competition, organization
- **Acknowledges tradeoffs explicitly** - What you're giving up, what could go wrong
- **Grounds ambition in reality** - Big vision, concrete first steps
- **Customer-back reasoning** - Start with the person you're serving, work backward to strategy

## Executive Summary

We should exit the SMB segment and refocus entirely on enterprise. This isn't
a retreat. It's a recognition that we've been fighting two different wars with
the same army, and losing both.

## Why Now

Three things changed this year. First, enterprise win rates climbed to 45%
while SMB dropped to 12%. Second, our best customers are asking for capabilities
that only make sense at enterprise scale. Third, two well-funded competitors
just entered SMB with pricing we can't match profitably.

The math is straightforward: enterprise customers generate 8x the lifetime value
at half the support cost. Every sales rep we move from SMB to enterprise
increases expected revenue by $400K annually.

## What We're Giving Up

Brand awareness. SMB customers talk. They blog. They tweet. Enterprise customers
sign NDAs. We'll need to find other ways to stay visible.

We're also giving up optionality. If enterprise sales slow, we won't have SMB
to fall back on. This is a one-way door.

## Why This Is Still Right

Because we're not good at SMB. We never were. We built an enterprise product
and tried to simplify it. That doesn't work. SMB customers need something
built from scratch for their constraints. That's a different company.

Better to be excellent at one thing than mediocre at two.

## Good Patterns

### Clear framing of the choice

```
This isn't a question of whether to invest in AI. It's a question of where.
We have three options: customer support (proven ROI, limited upside), product
features (uncertain ROI, high upside), or internal operations (moderate ROI,
fast payback). I recommend starting with operations. Here's why.
```

### Connecting customer insight to strategic implication

```
Our customers don't want a better dashboard. They want to stop looking at
dashboards entirely. They want alerts that tell them what to do, not charts
that tell them what happened. This has strategic implications: we need to
shift from information display to decision automation.
```

### Honest uncertainty

```
I'm confident about the direction. I'm less confident about the timing.
The market could move faster than we expect, or regulatory changes could
slow everything down. Our plan should work in either scenario, but we need
to build in review points.
```

## Anti-Patterns

### The laundry list

```
Bad:  Here are twelve strategic priorities for next year...
Good: We have one strategic priority: becoming the default choice for
      mid-market healthcare. Everything else supports that or gets cut.
```

### Strategy by buzzword

```
Bad:  We need to leverage AI to create seamless, omnichannel experiences
      that delight customers at every touchpoint.
Good: Customers call support for two reasons: to fix something or to
      learn something. AI can handle 60% of fix-it calls today. That's
      where we should start.
```

### Avoiding the hard call

```
Bad:  Both approaches have merit and we should monitor the situation.
Good: Approach A is better. Approach B has one advantage (speed), but
      speed matters less than getting this right. We should take the
      extra month.
