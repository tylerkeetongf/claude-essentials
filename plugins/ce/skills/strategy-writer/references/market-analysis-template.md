## Writing Tips

**Key Findings**: These should be insights, not facts. "The market is $50B" is a fact. "Growth is concentrated in a segment we don't currently serve" is an insight.

**Market size**: Use TAM/SAM/SOM framework. Be honest about what portion is actually addressable by us.

**Competitor analysis**: Avoid both dismissing competitors and overstating their strengths. Be honest about where we're ahead and behind.

**Trends**: Focus on trends that affect strategy. Not every industry trend is relevant to us.

**Implications**: This is the most important section. All analysis should build to "so what does this mean for us?"
