# Strategy Memo Template

Use this template for executive recommendations, strategic decisions, and opportunity assessments.

---

## Document Structure

```
# [Title]: [One-line framing of the decision]

## Executive Summary

[2-3 paragraphs maximum. State your recommendation clearly. Explain why it
matters. Acknowledge the key tradeoff. The reader should understand your
position and reasoning without reading further.]

## Context: Why This, Why Now

[What changed? What triggered this decision point? Why can't we wait?
Ground in customer need or market shift, not internal preference.]

## The Customer Problem

[Who is affected? How are they experiencing this? What's the cost of the
status quo for them? This section establishes why we should care.]

## Strategic Options

### Option A: [Name]

[Brief description, key advantages, key drawbacks. 2-3 paragraphs max.]

### Option B: [Name]

[Same structure. Include the do-nothing option if relevant.]

### Option C: [Name]

[If applicable. Don't pad with options you've already dismissed.]

## Recommendation: [Option Name]

[Restate your recommendation clearly. Then explain the reasoning in detail.
Why this option over others? What evidence supports this choice? Connect
back to customer problem and strategic context.]

## What We're Giving Up

[Be explicit about tradeoffs. What's the cost of this choice? What options
does it foreclose? This builds credibility and helps stakeholders make
informed decisions.]

## Risks and How We'll Manage Them

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk 1] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Specific action] |
| [Risk 2] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [Specific action] |

[Then discuss the most significant risks in prose. What would cause this to
fail? How would we know early? What would we do?]

## Implications and Next Steps

[What does this decision unlock or require? Who needs to do what? When?
Be specific about owners and timelines.]

| Action | Owner | Timeline |
|--------|-------|----------|
| [Action 1] | [Name/Team] | [Date] |
| [Action 2] | [Name/Team] | [Date] |

## Appendix (if needed)

[Supporting data, detailed analysis, additional context for those who want
to go deeper. Most readers should be able to make a decision without reading
the appendix.]

## Writing Tips

**Executive Summary**: Write this last. It should distill everything above into the shortest possible version that still supports decision-making.

**Context section**: Resist the urge to provide comprehensive history. Focus on what's changed and why timing matters.

**Options section**: Include real alternatives you considered, not strawmen. If there was only one viable option, say so and explain why.

**Recommendation section**: This is where you earn the conclusion. Don't just state preference, explain reasoning.

**Tradeoffs section**: This is often the weakest section in strategy memos. Don't skip it or soft-pedal it. Honest tradeoff discussion builds trust.

## Length Guidance

- Executive Summary: 1/2 to 1 page
- Full memo: 3-5 pages (excluding appendix)
- Appendix: As needed

If you need more than 5 pages for the main body, you're probably trying to cover too much. Consider splitting into multiple documents or moving detail to appendix.
