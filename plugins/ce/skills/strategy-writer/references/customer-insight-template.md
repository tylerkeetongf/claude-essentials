## Writing Tips

**Key Insights**: These should make people sit up. If the insights are obvious ("customers want things to be easier"), dig deeper or don't publish.

**Quotes**: Let customers speak in their own words. Quotes bring research to life in ways statistics cannot. But select carefully, don't dump every quote you collected.

**Limitations**: Acknowledging limitations builds credibility. Hiding them invites skepticism.

**Implications**: Connect every finding to "so what?" Research that doesn't lead to action is interesting but not useful.

**Recommendations**: Be specific. "Improve onboarding" is too vague. "Add progress indicator to step 3 of onboarding wizard" is actionable.

## Presentation Tips

**For stakeholders who are skeptical of qualitative research**:
- Lead with any quantitative data you have
- Frame quotes as data points, not anecdotes
- Triangulate with other sources (analytics, support tickets, etc.)

**For stakeholders who want to dive deeper**:
- Appendix should be rich with supporting material
- Offer to share recordings or transcripts (with appropriate permissions)
- Be prepared to discuss methodology in detail

## Length Guidance

- Key Insights summary: 1 page
- Full report: 5-10 pages (excluding appendix)
- Appendix: As needed

For executive audiences, create a 2-page summary: Key Insights, top 3 findings with one quote each, and Recommended Actions.
