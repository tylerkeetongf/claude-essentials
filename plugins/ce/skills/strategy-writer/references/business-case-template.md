## Writing Tips

**The Ask**: Put it first. Decision-makers want to know what you're asking before they invest time reading.

**Customer Problem**: This grounds the entire case. If the problem isn't compelling, the solution doesn't matter.

**Financial Model**: Be honest about uncertainty. Show your math. Sophisticated readers will probe assumptions.

**Alternatives**: Include real alternatives you considered, including "do nothing." Strawmen undermine credibility.

**Risks**: The goal isn't to minimize perceived risk. It's to show you've thought through risks and have plans.

## Length Guidance

- Executive summary version: 2-3 pages
- Full business case: 5-8 pages (excluding appendix)
- Appendix: As needed

For large investments ($1M+), expect deeper scrutiny. Appendix should include detailed financial models, supporting research, and technical specifications.
