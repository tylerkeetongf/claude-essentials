Do NOT skip to implementation.\nThe evaluation (Step 1) is WORTHLESS unless you ACTIVATE (Step 2) the skills.\n\nExample of correct sequence:\n- writing-plans: NO - not a planning task\n- documenting-code-comments: YES - need to write code comments\n- writing-tests: YES - writing tests\n\n[Then IMMEDIATELY use Skill() tool:]\n> Skill(documenting-code-comments)\n> Skill(writing-tests)\n\n[THEN and ONLY THEN start implementation]\n</INSTRUCTION>"
